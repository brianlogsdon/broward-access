# Broward Access 

An application to assist the homeless population of Broward County to find the resources available to them. 
The site provides an easy to use platform for to find information and also an interactive map of resources. Registered users can save locations and add their own helpful locations to the map for others to see. 
The front-end is built using React.js, and the Google maps API. The backend is built with Django and hosted on heroku, the code for that can be seen [here](https://github.com/brianlogsdon/broward_access_API).
